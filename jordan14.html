        Who could forget the “Lost shot”? It was Chicago Bulls vs Utah. Both with 86 on the scoreboard. And there was no time. The last minute had already begun, and the clock was ticking. One of the teams needed a point. It was Michael Jordan’s last match, and his team needed a point. Just one!And he appeared—as if out of nowhere, wearing the number 23 shirt, making his way through the Utah ranks, and exactly six seconds before the buzzer would go, Jordan scored.<br><br>The “Last Shot” was the biggest reason of fame for Air Jordan 14. Even if there had been nothing else, it would have alone made the Jordan 14 the rage it became. But there were other things. Michael Jordan didn’t go into the last match of his NBA career wearing them for no reason; he knew the worth of the 14s.<br><br>These were designed by Hatfield, and the inspiration for the design was Ferrari F355F1. Like Ferrari, Hatfield wanted them to be fast, with razor-like sharpness.So, he did his best to keep them as light as possible. The Air Jordan XIV replaced the heavy versions of the AJ family and became popular for being the lightest of all.With their light weight and sleek design, they redefined sports shoes. They also made another contribution to the family. They were the first in the AJ family to have the same number of the Jumpman logo as the model.
